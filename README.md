# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of [this project](https://github.com/Ctblossey/Election_Analysis) is to take a deeper look at the election results. By looking at the [data](https://github.com/Ctblossey/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv), you can see that there is really good information, but it needs to be analyzed. Key takeaways to look for with data like this are total votes, votes by county, turnout, votes received, and the winner of the election.
